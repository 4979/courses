## Cluster Analysis in Data Mining
by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://www.coursera.org/illinois)

Sessions: April 27th, 2015 to June 4th, 2015

### About the Course
Discover the basic concepts of cluster analysis, and then study a set of typical clustering methodologies, algorithms, and applications. This includes partitioning methods such as k-means, hierarchical methods such as BIRCH, density-based methods such as DBSCAN/OPTICS, probabilistic models, and the EM algorithm. Learn clustering and methods for clustering high dimensional data, streaming data, graph data, and networked data. Explore concepts and methods for constraint-based clustering and semi-supervised clustering. Finally, see examples of cluster analysis in applications.
